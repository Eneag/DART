- decide wether to use millis or micros in the PID.
- decide wether to upload a set of data every 10Hz or save them in the internal memory and upload it every 10Hz (1 or 10 sets of data)
- decide if it is woth it to work with int math (3.4 -> 3.5 *2 -> 7), losing precision but getting more speed (last straw)
